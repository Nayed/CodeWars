I've got a crazy mental illness. I dislike numbers a lot. But it's a little complicated: The number I'm feared of depends on which day of week it is... This a concrete description of my mental illness:

Monday --> 12

Tuesday --> numbers greater than 95

Wednesday --> 34

Thursday --> 0

Friday --> numbers divisable by 2

Saturday --> 56

Sunday --> 666 or -666

Write a function which takes a string (day of week) and an integer (number to be tested) so it tells the doctor if I'm feared or not. (return a boolean)
